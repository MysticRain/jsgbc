JS GBC
=================

About
-----------------

JS GBC is a project that aims to bring GameBoy Color emulation capabilites to any browser which supports modern web standards. Mobile devices are the top priority right now, with iOS being the main testing platform. 

This project is based on Grant Galitz's fantastic [GameBoy-Online emulator](https://github.com/grantgalitz/GameBoy-Online). It has been modified and optimized to run on mobile devices.

Scope
-----------------

Currently, the only device which is officially supported is the iPhone 5 using iOS 6. Official support is planned to next spread to iOS devices based on their hardware capabilities and iOS version. The devices which should be officially supported next are:

*   iPad (4th & 3rd gen)
*   iPhone 4S, iPad (2nd gen), iPad Mini, iPod Touch (5th gen)

Android devices are an unknown. When running JS GBC on Android devices, be sure to use Chrome instead of the stock browser (performance is much better). I would greatly apppreciate any reports of how this runs, especially on the more powerful Android devices.
